# RailsLite

## Summary

In a feat of metaprogramming I recreated the core functionality of ActiveRecord and ActionController, the base classes for Ruby on Rails Models and Controllers, respectively. With my lite version of Rails, you can create a basic website with associations, flash, and even user auth.

Not that I would recommend using my version over the real thing just yet.

## How to use

Start up the server by running bin/run.rb.

Some test models and controllers have been implemented. Try visiting /pants and adding a new pant or shoe or two.

## Coming soon

Macros for creating your own models and controllers from the command line, just like 'rails g' do!
